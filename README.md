## About me

I am a Computer Science M. Sc. student. My research interests are knowledge representation and processing of math, and lately also programming language theory.

I contribute to the [MMT project](https://uniformal.github.io/) ([UniFormal/MMT on GitHub](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT)), a larger research software written in Scala which lets you formalize a broad range of formal knowledge: math, logic, type theory, and foundations. MMT and many of its algorithms are [foundation-independent](https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/Research/rabe_future_15.pdf): with bare MMT, you don't even have natural numbers, let alone functions. The beauty is versatility; the challenge generality.

For more info and publications, see my [academic website](https://kwarc.info/people/nroux/).

More hobby-wise, I am dabbling in the [Coq Proof Assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/) and, e.g., formalized my own flavor of [an ontology language](https://github.com/ComFreek/basic-ontology-language) and [a lambda calculus with de Bruijn indices](https://github.com/ComFreek/lambda-coq).

Programming-wise, I mostly fancy Scala and the latest TypeScript/ECMAScript.
